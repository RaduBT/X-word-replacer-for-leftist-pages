# Twitter-word-replace
A Chrome extension for replacing words on X (Twitter) exclusively.

### Files
* [manifest.json](manifest.json) is necessary for Chrome and tells the extension to use X exclusively, so the words won't be replaced on other websites. Edit this file to add your extension's title, description, and version number etc. Don't rename this file.
* [replaceWord.js](replaceWord.js) is a script that takes the content from tweets and replaces the words if it finds them.

### Customise
Edit [manifest.json](manifest.json) to give your extension a title and description.

To choose the words to be replaced, edit line 6 in [replaceWord.js](replaceWord.js):

```javascript
var newContent = el.innerHTML.replace(/OLD_WORD_NO_QUOTATION_MARKS/g,"NEW_WORD_IN_QUOTATION MARKS");
```
Here's an example to replace the word "beauty" with "chickens":

```javascript
var newContent = el.innerHTML.replace(/beauty/g,"chickens");
```

Here's another example to replace the word "democracy" with "bureaucracy":

```javascript
var newContent = el.innerHTML.replace(/democracy/g,"bureaucracy");
```

## Installing the extension
This Chome extension requires the manifest.json and replaceWord.js files to be zipped into one file and added to the browser (or uploaded to the [Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish)).

A friend used this extension to replace "beauty" with "chickens". Here's a screenshot they sent me.
